#+title: Youtube mpv browser extension

A browser extension to play youtube video from [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] (with the help of [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp)]] via [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging#native-messaging-host-protocol][native messaging protocol]].
It is still a very rough MVP. Play with it at yout own risk.
* Install
** The extension
*** Install [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/download][typescript]] if you don't have it.
To check if you have got tsc and fyi my tsc version.
#+begin_src bash
tsc -v
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Version 5.2.2

*** Compile the extension, run
#+begin_src shell
tsc
#+end_src
Newly compiled js will be inside [[file:extension/][./extension]], now this is your extension.
*** To use the extension
**** For example for chromium based browsers:
- [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked][Load it unpacked]]
- Or :: [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/distribute/host-extensions#create][Pack it]].

** The native host application
*** Install ghc + cabal if you don't have it
Probably use [[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/][ghcup]] to install them.
To check if you have got ghc/cabal and fyi my ghc/cabal version.
#+begin_src bash
ghc --version
cabal --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| The           | Glorious | Glasgow  |  Haskell | Compilation | System, | version |   9.6.3 |
| cabal-install | version  | 3.10.2.1 |          |             |         |         |         |
| compiled      | using    | version  | 3.10.2.1 | of          | the     | Cabal   | library |
*** Compile the native host
#+begin_src bash
cabal build -O2
#+end_src
**** To find the path to the compiled executable, and fyi mine is at
#+begin_src bash
cabal list-bin youtube-mpv-native-host
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /Users/fanshi/Personal/chrome-extensions/youtube-mpv/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-osx/ghc-9.6.3/youtube-mpv-native-host-0.1.0.0/x/youtube-mpv-native-host/build/youtube-mpv-native-host/youtube-mpv-native-host

** To register a native messaging host
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging#native-messaging-host
- fyi I make the file at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/youtube.mpv.json, [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging#native-messaging-host-location][but your location might be different.]]
#+begin_src json
{
  "name": "youtube.mpv",
  "description": "play youtube with mpv",
  "path": "${path to your compiled native host executable}",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_origins": ["chrome-extension://${extension-id}/"]
}
#+end_src
- And if you are not using chrome, [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Chrome_incompatibilities#native_messaging][check this]] and adapt.
** Hey, of course
You need a browser([[https://www.google.com/chrome/][Chrome]] for example) and [[https://mpv.io/][Mpv]] + [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation][yt-dlp]] (and [[https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#options-ytdl-path][to setup ytdl path for mpv as needed]])
* Usage
Turn on the extension and goto [[https://youtube.com][youtube]], click on any video and see it youself (via =mpv= of course).
